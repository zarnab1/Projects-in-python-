So here are the projects I had done in Data Science
# PROJECT 1
<br />

## Project 1 is related to data augmentation
<br />
This incraeses the data as to yield better results
<br />

# PROJECT 2
<br />

## Project 2 is Project Credit Card Application
<br />
I have done this project from DataCamp
In this project, 
in the first step , we have to see datset. 
the dataset will be analysed by the data it contain. 
then the prediction will be made using certain machine learning algorithms. 
the algorithms will prove that model is accurate at prediction 
<br />


# PROJECT 3
<br />

## Project 3 is related to coil
<br />
in this we have loaded images.
prepared the dataset using images.
split the dataset in 3 models, train , test and validate. 
the model is designed in this way 
and un the last model is being tested as to see the results.
